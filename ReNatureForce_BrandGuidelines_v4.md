## 01 · The Ecosystem — Dual Architecture

> The Rə:Ecosystem operates on two simultaneous levels, addressing different audiences while sharing a common DNA.

Rə:NatureFørce and Rə:Vive La Palma are not the same brand with two names. They are two expressions of a shared core — like mycelium and fruit of the same organism. Invisibly connected, visibly distinct.

### Macro Level — Rə:NatureFørce

| | |
|---|---|
| **Focus** | Systemic transformation · Policy · Impact Investing |
| **Audience** | Cabildo · EU · NGOs · Impact Funds |
| **Tone** | Philosophical · Academically precise · Manifest |
| **Visual System** | Terrain Depth · Earth Cream dominant · Organic strata |
| **Internal aesthetic** | Living Earth — Geological depth, Ma, Fibonacci organism |

### Micro Level — Rə:Vive La Palma

| | |
|---|---|
| **Focus** | Operative services · Broker tools · Listing optimization |
| **Audience** | Real estate agents · Developers · Investors |
| **Tone** | Warm-precise · ROI-grounded · Understated confidence |
| **Visual System** | Organic Precision Dark · The Void dominant · Leaf Laminate (UI) |
| **Internal aesthetic** | Natural Solarpunk × Avantgarde Prestige |

### Shared DNA — Non-Negotiable

| Principle | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Rə: as core mark** | The schwa symbol (ə) + colon is the only immutable brand element. Always in Gold (dark bg) or Cream (light bg). |
| **60/30/10** | Color distribution applies to both levels — palettes differ, ratios do not. |
| **Golden Ratio φ** | All proportions, layouts and spacing follow φ = 1.618, regardless of level. |
| **No empty promises** | Every claim is verifiable. No hyperbole, no marketing speak. Both levels. |
| **Sacred Geometry** | Structural, never decorative. Dodecahedron, Fibonacci, Vesica Piscis: always as a depth layer. |
| **AI as tool of nature** | AI usage is regeneratively justified and transparently labelled in both levels. |
| **Coherence** | Every design decision is traceable to the core philosophy. No aesthetic without reason. |

### Logo Hierarchy — Immutable

Rə:NatureFørce is the **parent brand (Macro)**. Rə:Vive La Palma is the **operative sub-brand (Micro)**. This hierarchy is non-negotiable. Rə:Vive La Palma never acts in contradiction to Rə:NatureFørce's values.

## 02 · Quick Reference — The Minimum

> The single question for every creative decision: **Does this contribute to regeneration — or to exhaustion?**

| | Both Levels | Rə:NatureFørce (Macro) | Rə:Vive La Palma (Micro) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Color** | 60/30/10 rule | 60% Earth Cream · 30% Forest Deep · 10% Sacred Gold | 60% The Void · 30% Volcanic Slate · 10% Brushed Brass |
| **Typography** | φ-based scale | Fraunces · Syne · Inter | EB Garamond · Inter · JetBrains Mono |
| **Depth System** | No Leaf Laminate in Macro | Terrain Depth (color strata, gold fault lines) | Leaf Laminate (UI-Cards, Overlays) |
| **Aesthetic** | φ · organic precision | Living Earth · Ma (間) · Geological strata | Organic Precision Dark · Warm-precise · Data-grounded |
| **Tone** | No empty promises | Inviting · Poetic · Academic Manifest | Warm-precise · Understatement · Data-anchored |

## 03 · Brand Identity — Core & Stance

### Mission

Reorganize human progress as a regenerative extension of nature — not an extractive system. Collectively channel knowledge, creativity and technology into the service of living systems: not as sacrifice, but as investment with exponential return.

### Vision

A world where people live their purpose in harmony with the rhythms of the earth. Experience spaces — gardens, dojos, laboratories, properties, digital rooms — where this perspective is not explained but directly lived.

### Brand Values — Hierarchical

| Priority | Value | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Regeneration** | Everything we do enriches. Soils, people, systems, capital, ideas. |
| 2 | **Resonance** | Connection before reaction. Silence before noise. Listening before speaking. |
| 3 | **Coherence** | Inner and outer action are congruent. No facade. Never. |
| 4 | **Formlessness** | Adaptability is highest strength. Never rigid, always recognizable. (Lee: Water) |
| 5 | **Completeness** | 12 as cosmic wholeness. No part is missing. Nothing is superfluous. |

### Brand Personality

| | |
|---|---|
| **Archetype** | The Wise Revolutionary — Prophet without dogma — Healer without hierarchy |
| **Energy** | Calm and powerful — like water immediately before the vortex |
| **Stance** | Radical responsibility without blame. Trust in the intrinsically good. |
| **Never** | Esoterically vague · Elitist without substance · Apocalyptic · Moralizing |

## 04 · Logo & Mark System

### Construction & Meaning

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Rə:** | R + schwa (ə) + colon. Schwa = rotation, regeneration, return. Colon = "definition follows" (as in code). Immutable. |
| **Rə:NatureFørce** | Macro level. Ø in Førce: Nordic cyclicality, cosmic completeness. The ratio of 'Rə:Nature' to 'Førce' corresponds to φ. |
| **Rə:Vive La Palma** | Micro level. Vive = living, active, now. La Palma as physical place and metaphor for transformation. |
| **Rə:** (solo) | Solo mark for favicon, icons, minimal contexts. Gold on dark or dark on light. |

### Spelling

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary Macro** | Rə:NatureFørce |
| **Primary Micro** | Rə:Vive La Palma |
| **Shortform** | RNF (Macro) · RVP (Micro) — only when context is unambiguous |
| **Hashtag** | #ReNatureForce · #ReviveLaPalma (technical simplification) |
| **Forbidden** | ReNatureForce · RENATUREFORCE · re:natureforce · RenatureForce |

### Color Variants

| Variant | Macro Application | Micro Application |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Light | Forest Deep on Earth Cream | — |

## 05 · Color — 60/30/10 × 2

> The 60/30/10 principle applies to both levels — the palettes differ, the ratio is universal. Color is not style, it is frequency.

### Macro — Rə:NatureFørce · Terrain Depth

Earth Cream says: silence, growth, inward. 60% light and breathing space, 30% depth and rootedness, 10% gold of the golden ratio.

---

### Micro — Rə:Vive La Palma · Organic Precision Dark

The Void is not a void — it is deep forest at 3am, lava earth before it cools, old malachite. Brushed Brass is not bling — it is oxidized copper, worked metal, the color of instruments made to last a century. The palette draws from nature's own prestige materials, not from finance aesthetics.

#### 60% — The Void Family

| Token | Hex | RGB | Origin |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--void-primary` | `#0F1A15` | 15, 26, 21 | Deep forest floor · malachite interior |
| `--void-secondary` | `#0B120F` | 11, 18, 15 | Obsidian · lava at depth |
| `--void-deep` | `#022C22` | 2, 44, 34 | Ancient moss · deep water |

#### 30% — Volcanic Slate Family

### 10% — Sacred Gold / Brushed Brass Family (Shared)

Gold and Brass are the same material at different ages. Sacred Gold (Macro) is freshly cast. Brushed Brass (Micro) has been worked, used, earned. Both reference the same organic metallic spectrum found in nature — pyrite, sunlit amber, pollen.

| Token | Hex | RGB | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--gold-primary` | `#B8912A` | 184, 145, 42 | Macro primary accent · CTAs · φ · Pantone 873 C |

## 06 · Typography — Four Fonts. One System.

The typographic system connects four fonts into a coherent organism. Core principle: depth (serif) and clarity (sans-serif) in dialogue, not competition.

### Fraunces — Display, Quotes, Manifesto (Macro)

| | |
|---|---|
| **License** | SIL Open Font License · Google Fonts · Free for commercial use |
| **Character** | Organic, warm, slightly 'irregular'. Variable Optical Size: smaller feels classical, large feels expressive. Living imperfection is human-made quality. |
| **Why** | Timeless without feeling dated. Not associated with other brands. Carries the Manifesto frequency. |
| **Use** | Cover titles · Chapter headings · Pull quotes · Manifesto texts · Event signage |
| **Weights** | Fraunces 700 Bold (Display) · Fraunces 400 Italic (Quotes) · Fraunces 300 Light (atmospheric) |
| **Fallback** | Playfair Display · Georgia |

### Syne — Labels, Navigation, Tags (Macro)

| | |
|---|---|
| **License** | SIL Open Font License · Google Fonts · Free for commercial use |
| **Character** | Geometric, idiosyncratic, self-confident. Wide letterforms with unusual details. Strongly recognizable without being intrusive. |
| **Use** | Chapter labels · Tags · UI labels · Navigation · Infographic annotations |
| **Weights** | Syne 700 (Labels, Uppercase) · Syne 400 (UI text) |
| **Fallback** | Outfit · Poppins |

### EB Garamond — Display (Micro)

| | |
|---|---|
| **License** | SIL Open Font License · Google Fonts · Free for commercial use |
| **Character** | Classic-elegant, prestige signal, deep cultural heritage. Against The Void it creates warm-on-dark contrast — like candlelight on stone. Not tech, not corporate. Humanist. |
| **Why** | In dark-mode contexts it is more coherent than Fraunces. Carries authority without coldness — essential for Organic Precision. |
| **Use** | Hero headlines · Quotes in Micro media · Pitch decks · Proposals |
| **Weights** | EB Garamond 700 (Hero) · EB Garamond 400 Italic (Quotes) · EB Garamond 500 (Subheads) |
| **Fallback** | Cormorant Garamond · Georgia |

### Inter — UI, Body (Shared)

| | |
|---|---|
| **License** | SIL Open Font License · Google Fonts · Free for commercial use |
| **Character** | Clear, neutral, warm. Geometric-humanist. Best readability for UI and long-form text. |
| **Use Macro** | Body copy · Brochures · Emails · Long-form web text |

| Data / Metrics | — | JetBrains Mono 600 · 24–48px |

### φ in Typography

Font size ratios follow the golden ratio where practical: Body (18pt) → H3 (29pt, ×φ) → H2 (47pt, ×φ²). Natural visual harmony without rigid modular-scale constraints.

### Forbidden

| | |
|---|---|
| Never | More than 2 font families simultaneously in a single layout element |
| Never | System defaults as primary typeface (Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri, Helvetica) |
| Never | Serif font for body text below 15pt |
| Micro specific | Fraunces in Void-Dark context — use EB Garamond there |
| Macro specific | JetBrains Mono outside data contexts — technically cold in Manifesto surroundings |

---

## 07 · Design Principles — φ · Terrain Depth · Leaf Laminate

The ecosystem operates two visual systems sharing the same skeleton (φ, 60/30/10, Sacred Geometry) while developing two coherent but distinct aesthetics. Both now derive from the same philosophical source — they are no longer in tension.

### φ — The Shared Anchor

| Application | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Page split** | φ-split: 61.8% primary content · 38.2% secondary |
| **Proportions** | All images, cards, containers: width × φ = height (or inverse) |
| **Spacing (Fibonacci)** | 8 · 13 · 21 · 34 · 55 · 89 · 144pt — always from this scale, never arbitrary |
| **Typography** | Font size ratios follow φ where practical |
| **Logo** | Rə:Nature to Førce in character space = 1 : φ |

---

### Macro — Terrain Depth

Terrain Depth is derived from geological cross-sections, the Japanese concept of Ma (間 — meaningful emptiness), and the way earth lives in stratified layers. No blur effects, no transparency tricks, no trends. Depth through material honesty.

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Layering** | Overlapping Earth Cream tones (Primary → Mid → Deep) create depth through color field stacking. No `backdrop-filter`, no `box-shadow`. |
| **Gold fault lines** | 1px Sacred Gold lines as tectonic fault lines between strata layers. |
| **Ma (間)** | Empty space is active content. Minimum 120px between sections. Earth Cream is never 'empty' — it is silence. |
| **Corners** | `border-radius: 4px` maximum. Organic, not soft-round. Edges are the reality of earth. |
| **Shadows** | No drop shadows. Depth through color layers and gold lines, not simulated light. |
| **Composition** | Fibonacci spiral as compositional principle. Flowing transitions between sections. |
| **Texture** | Subtle grain (5–8% opacity) on Earth Cream surfaces for organic imperfection. |

**Macro Anti-Patterns**

| | |
|---|---|
| ❌ Leaf Laminate | `backdrop-filter: blur()` is Micro-exclusive. Never in the Macro arm. |
| ❌ Gradient backgrounds | Simulate depth instead of showing it — dishonest. |
| ❌ Neon / Glow | No glow-shadow, no `filter: brightness()` as stylistic device. |
| ❌ Soft round | `border-radius > 4px` only for images (max 8px). No pill-buttons. |

### Micro — Organic Precision Dark (internal: Natural Solarpunk × Avantgarde Prestige)

> This section uses the internal design vocabulary. The external descriptor for all client-facing and agency-facing materials is **Organic Precision**. See Chapter 08 for the full risk mitigation protocol.

The Micro arm resolves the contradiction that Prestige Brutalism could not: it is simultaneously dark, precise, and warm. Its reference points are not finance aesthetics but nature's own prestige materials — malachite, oxidized copper, deep forest canopy, Kengo Kuma's layered timber screens, the section of a nautilus shell. Cold precision without coldness. Warmth without softness.

**The four constitutive principles:**

**1. Living Dark** — The Void is not absence of color. It is full, deep, saturated dark green. Every background decision starts from `#0F1A15` and asks: how does a living thing occupy this space?

**2. Craft Precision** — Edges are knife-sharp not because brutalism demands it, but because craft demands it. A hand-forged instrument has precise edges. `border-radius: 1px` (not 0, not 8px — craft precision leaves the trace of the maker). Tolerance: 0–2px maximum.

**3. Leaf Laminate** — The visual effect of light through layered organic material: translucent, warm, stratified. Technically identical to Glassmorphism but conceptually distinct — the mental model changes every other decision (opacity, warmth of tint, border character). Recipe below.

**4. Botanical Grid** — Background patterns derived from plant cell structures and cross-sections, not from UI frameworks. A grid that looks like it was discovered, not designed.

#### Detailed Rules

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Base structure** | Craft precision edges (1–2px radius). 12-column grid per φ asymmetry. Typography size does the heavy lifting — not color contrast. |
| **Leaf Laminate (UI)** | Only for: cards, overlays, modal dialogs, dropdown menus, floating nav after scroll. |
| **Leaf Laminate recipe** | `background: rgba(44,51,48,0.55)` · `backdrop-filter: blur(16px) saturate(1.2)` · `border: 1px solid rgba(197,179,136,0.12)` · Never on full-page backgrounds. |
| **Warm tint** | The Laminate background uses Slate (green-warm) not neutral grey — preserves the organic warmth. |
| **Botanical grid** | `background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(197,179,136,0.04) 1px, transparent 1px)` · `background-size: 34px 34px` (Fibonacci). NOT the generic square grid. |
| **Data as organism** | KPI numbers are living things. Brass SVG lines for graphs that grow like vines, not like bar charts. JetBrains Mono makes numbers precise without making them cold. |
| **Hover states** | Brass border emergence: `box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgba(197,179,136,0.25)` — like a plant finding light. Never brutal color switch. |
| **Animations** | `ease-in-out` · 400–700ms · `cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)` · Grows and breathes, never snaps. |
| **Corners** | 1–2px maximum. This is craft precision, not brutalism. The distinction matters for how every subsequent decision gets made. |

**Micro Anti-Patterns**

| | |
|---|---|
| ❌ Terrain Depth in Micro | Earth Cream as background destroys The Void's prestige depth. |
| ❌ Leaf Laminate behind text | Laminate is for containers, never for text backgrounds. |
| ❌ Generic square grid | The UI-framework grid aesthetic. Use botanical radial pattern only. |
| ❌ Cold grey tints | All semi-transparent layers tint toward green-warm Slate, never neutral grey. |
| ❌ Glow effects | No `box-shadow` as light source, no `filter: brightness()`, no neon. |
| ❌ Generic 3D blobs | No gradient shape without meaning. No AI-slop style. |
| ❌ Cyberpunk signals | Scan-line animations · glitch text · cyan/purple palette · "SYSTEM BOOT" language. These are the antithesis of Organic Precision. |

### Shared Animation Principles

| | |
|---|---|
| **Curve** | Always `ease-in-out` · `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` · Never linear or bounce |
| **Speed** | 400–700ms for transitions · 150–250ms for micro-interactions |
| **Scroll (Micro)** | Lenis: `duration: 1.2` · `easing: Math.min(1, 1.001 - Math.pow(2, -10 * t))` |
| **Scroll (Macro)** | GSAP ScrollTrigger · slow reveals · no parallax overload |
| **Motion reduction** | All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — disable or reduce to opacity-only |
| **Forbidden** | Bounce · Auto-play video with sound · Horizontal scroll (except carousels) · Flash · Linear easing |

## 08 · Aesthetic Philosophy & Risk Mitigation

> This chapter exists because naming is power — and the same aesthetic can be named in ways that open or close doors. The internal name is precise. The external name is strategic.

### Why the Internal Name Matters

"Natural Solarpunk × Avantgarde Prestige" is the working concept for designers, developers, and briefing documents. It answers the question every aesthetic decision eventually asks: *what mental universe does this belong to?*

Without a precise internal name, teams default to adjacent aesthetics — and for a dark, precise, premium interface, the default is almost always either Cyberpunk (cold, synthetic) or Finance Dark (corporate, lifeless). Both are wrong. The internal name prevents this drift by pointing toward the correct reference field: craft, nature, organisms, worked material, deep forest, Kengo Kuma, Art Nouveau precision.

**The internal name is a compass, not a label.**

### Why "Solarpunk" Stays Internal

"Solarpunk" as a word carries cultural associations that, while accurate to the aesthetic, activate specific reader-frames in certain audiences:

| Audience | Risk of the Word "Solarpunk" | What They Actually See |
|---|---|---|
| **Real estate brokers (La Palma)** | "Environmental activism" — may trigger resistance | Warm dark premium interface. They respond positively. |
| **EU institutional contacts** | "Tech subculture" — may seem niche | Serious, organic precision. They see quality. |
| **Impact investors** | Neutral to positive, but unnecessary | Data-precision + warmth. They see investment-grade. |
| **Designers / agencies** | Immediately useful and clarifying | Correct aesthetic direction. Name is essential. |

**Rule:** "Solarpunk" and "Natural Solarpunk × Avantgarde Prestige" appear in: internal guidelines, design system documentation, creative briefs, agency onboarding, design reviews.

They do **not** appear in: client-facing proposals, broker materials, press releases, public-facing About pages, social media, or any external touchpoint.

### The External Descriptor: Organic Precision

"Organic Precision" is the external name for the Micro arm's aesthetic. It communicates the two constitutive tensions accurately:

- **Organic** — natural materials, warm dark palette, living geometry, craft
- **Precision** — sharp edges, exact data, understatement, no decoration without function

It requires no subculture knowledge to understand. It is a descriptor, not a label. It cannot be misread.

| Context | Use |
|---|---|
| Internal creative work | Natural Solarpunk × Avantgarde Prestige |
| Agency/freelancer briefings | Organic Precision + reference images + internal concept doc (NDA) |
| Client presentations | Organic Precision |
| Press / media | "Dark, warm, precise" or "contemporary organic design" — never a label |
| Social media | Show the work, never name the system |

### Reference Field — What Designers Should Study

The correct reference field for the Micro arm's aesthetic. These are not mood board requests — they are conceptual anchors.

| Reference | Why |
|---|---|
| **Kengo Kuma** (architecture) | Material honesty · layered organic depth · craft precision without ornamentation |
| **Vo Trong Nghia** (architecture) | Living green structures · darkness as positive space · warm prestige |
| **Ernst Haeckel** (scientific illustration) | Nature as geometric precision · radial patterns · biological ornament |
| **Arts & Crafts movement** | Material truth · function-derived form · worked metal as prestige signal |
| **Dezeen / Wallpaper editorial design** | Dark premium context · typography-led · data and beauty coexistent |
| **Nobuyoshi Araki** (photography) | Deep black as presence, not absence · warmth within darkness |
| **Leica camera design** | Worked brass · precision engineering · timeless without being retro |

### What This Is Not

| Mislabelling | Why It's Wrong |
|---|---|
| Cyberpunk | Synthetic, cold, neon, tech-extraction. Opposite of organic. |
| Biophilic Design | Superficial greenery, plants as decoration. We are talking about structural logic derived from biology. |
| Dark Academia | Nostalgic, literary, passive. We are active, precise, forward. |
| Eco-chic | Greenwashing aesthetics. We make no visual claims of sustainability. |
| Finance Dark | Bloomberg Terminal, cold grey, institutional. No warmth, no organism. |

## 09 · Sound Branding — 432 Hz

> A brand that defines resonance as its core principle requires an acoustic identity.

### The 432 Hz Principle

| | |
|---|---|
| **Tuning** | 432 Hz (instead of standard 440 Hz) as base tuning for all brand compositions |
| **Aesthetic** | Feels warmer, more earthy, less synthetic than 440 Hz. Justifiable as an aesthetic choice without spiritual overclaiming. |
| **External communication** | "We tune our brand audio to 432 Hz as an aesthetic choice — warmer, more grounded." No healing claims. |

### Sound Character — Macro

| | |
|---|---|
| **Instruments** | Tibetan singing bowls · Shakuhachi flute · Acoustic guitar (unamplified) |
| **Character** | Silence as instrument. Nature sounds (water, wind, earth). Quiet double bass. |
| **Reference energy** | Ólafur Arnalds · Jon Hopkins · Masayoshi Takanaka |
| **Forbidden** | Synthetic EDM drop · Aggressive brass · Overproduced pop sound |

### Sound Character — Micro

| | |
|---|---|
| **Instruments** | Minimal piano · Quiet electronic ambient on 432 Hz base · No recognizable vocals |
| **Character** | Warm precision. Like a workshop where someone who knows exactly what they're doing works in focused silence. |
| **Reference energy** | Nils Frahm · Max Richter · Sohn |

### Applications

| | |
|---|---|
| **Brand sound (logo)** | 3–5 seconds · Singing bowl + silent fade · 432 Hz tuned · both levels |
| **Event / video intro** | 10–20 seconds · Water + tone + silence (Macro) · Piano fade (Micro) |
| **Ambient spaces** | Generative sound for physical experience spaces (Macro) and showrooms (Micro) |
| **Silence as statement** | 3 seconds of silence before a mantra is not a mistake. It is content. |

## 10 · Tone of Voice — Two Voices. One Core.

> We do not speak to people. We speak from within them. Our words are not loudspeakers — they are tuning forks.

### Universal Prohibitions (Both Levels)

| | |
|---|---|
| ❌ Hyperbole | World-leading · Unique (unless provable) · Game-changer · Revolutionary |
| ❌ Fake urgency | "Only 3 spots left!" → Instead: "Current cycle capacity: 4/15 committed." |
| ❌ Empty promises | No claim without proof. Every statement has a source or a number. |
| ❌ Marketing speak | Synergies · Holistic solutions · Disruption · Growth-hacking · ESG as checkbox |

### Macro — Rə:NatureFørce — Philosophical · Manifest

| | |
|---|---|
| **Persona** | The Wise Revolutionary · System architect without ego |
| **Context** | Academic papers · Policy briefs · Grant applications · Manifesto · Events |
| **Characteristics** | Precise and poetic simultaneously. Technical terminology when warranted (Panarchy, MECE, Doughnut Economics). The nine archetypes as subtext. |
| **Structure** | Inviting, not demanding. Long, deliberate sentences permitted. Silence after large statements. |
| **Good** | *"La Palma is in the Ω-phase (Panarchy). Our intervention identifies structural lock-ins in the banana monoculture system."* |
| **Bad** | *"We help La Palma become greener!"* |

### Micro — Rə:Vive La Palma — Warm Precision · Data-Grounded

The v4.0 update: the Micro persona is no longer "cold Prestige Consultant." It is **warm-precise** — the confidence of someone who knows their craft deeply enough not to perform it. Like a master cabinetmaker who quotes a price without explaining why it's fair. You know from the work.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Persona** | The Craft Master. Warm, precise, never performative. Confidence from depth, not from posture. |
| **Context** | Landing pages · Proposals · Broker communication · Pitch decks · Emails |
| **Characteristics** | Short, clean sentences. Active voice, YOU-focused. Every statement is grounded in data or direct observation. Warmth in precision, not despite it. |
| **Structure** | Headlines < 10 words. Data in monospace type. Never more words than needed. |
| **Good** | *"La Palma properties are not sold. They are transferred to the right hands. We reduce time-to-match by 73%."* |
| **Bad (cold)** | *"Properties are not sold. They are curated."* (v3.0 — correct but performatively cool) |
| **Bad (warm-vague)** | *"We find the perfect home for every property with our unique approach!"* |

### Platform Differentiation

| Platform | Macro Tone | Micro Tone |
|---|---|---|
| Instagram | Short · atmospheric · one image — one sentence | Craft detail · before/after · quiet confidence |
| LinkedIn | Systemic essay format | ROI-focus · numbers · warm understatement |
| Newsletter | Philosophical · mantra at end | Property updates · craft insight · cycle status |
| Event / stage | Slow · pause-rich · mantra | Precise · grounded · one claim per slide |
| Email | Invite, not convince | Direct · max 3 bullets · warm CTA |

### Martin Reiter — Personal Voice

Martin Reiter speaks in first person as channel, transformer, pointer — not as CEO or guru. His voice is recognizably more personal than the institutional brands. He fully shares their philosophy, but his tone is more vulnerable, reflective, and experience-based. Rə:NatureFørce as institution survives the person. Martin does not post on behalf of the brand — he posts as a human who lives it.

## 11 · The Nine Archetypes — Frequencies, Not References

The nine archetypes resonate as a depth system in the Macro arm — as intellectual reference for academic and impact investor audiences. In the Micro arm they are subtext, never direct quotation.

| Archetype | Frequency |
|---|---|
| **Masanobu Fukuoka** | Mu — Non-doing · Subtractive communication · Less is more · Natural farming |
| **Viktor Schauberger** | Implosion — Pull principle · Attraction over pressure · Movement from within · Living water |
| **Nikola Tesla** | Resonance — Receiving before sending · Inner simulation · Cosmic connection |
| **Bruno Gröning** | Healing stream — Collective attunement · Community as force field |
| **Wilhelm Reich** | Orgone — Dissolving armor · Creating free space · Body as truth witness |
| **Bruce Lee** | Formlessness — Be like water · Adaptive · Context-aware · Never rigid |
| **Rudolf Steiner** | Spiritual science — The farm as organism · Biodynamics · Systemic thinking |
| **Miyamoto Musashi** | Ku — Emptiness · Decisions from silence · Strategy without ego |
| **Jesus Christ** | Love as law · Parable thinking · The inward kingdom · Abba relationship |

> Shared truth of all nine: Trust in the intrinsically good, radical responsibility, practical spirituality in everyday life.

**Note:** These names appear in external communication only when context allows depth. In fast social media formats they are subtext, not text. In the Micro arm they do not appear.

## 12 · AI & Technology — AI as Servant of Nature

> AI can exponentially nourish or exponentially exhaust. We choose the former — consciously, not ideologically.

The guiding question is not carbon accounting (too narrow), but: **Does this AI application serve living systems?** Soils, water, community, body, capital, mind?

### Permitted AI Applications (Regenerative)

| Application | Description |
|---|---|
| **Soil analysis** | AI-powered analysis of soil condition, microbiome, water balance for regenerative agriculture |
| **Image generation** | Nature motifs, concept images, Sacred Geometry — labelled AI-assisted, nature-aligned |
| **Text assistance** | Drafting, research, translation — always human-revised and accountable |
| **Pattern recognition** | Growth patterns, pest detection, water quality in real time (Macro) |
| **Listing optimization** | AI-enhanced visuals, SEO copy, subsidy mapping (Micro) |
| **Sound generation** | Generative ambient soundscapes on 432 Hz base |
| **Tone analyzer (Q3 2026)** | Planned: automatic copy check against brand voice guidelines |

### Forbidden

| | |
|---|---|
| **Deception** | Presenting AI content as human — incompatible with the coherence value |
| **Extraction** | AI for optimizing natural resource extraction without a regeneration plan |
| **Mass manipulation** | Micro-targeting, dark patterns, conversion optimization against user interests |
| **Field substitute** | AI never replaces real nature connection, physical presence, direct experience |

### Labelling Policy

| Context | Label Required |
|---|---|
| AI image | 'AI-assisted' in caption — always, no exception |
| AI text | 'Created with AI support' in imprint/footer — for longer texts |
| AI sound | 'Generative audio' — in event and content contexts |
| Internal | No labelling needed for internal processes and research assistance |

## 13 · Imagery — Photography · Data · Sacred Geometry

> Every image should trigger the feeling: something alive is here.

### Photography — Macro

| | |
|---|---|
| **Light** | Natural light · Golden hour · Dusk · No studio flash |
| **Subjects** | Close-up soil · Water in motion · Hands at field work · People in silent concentration · Plants in growth |
| **Mood** | Contemplative · Reverent · Focused. Never hectic or staged. |
| **Color grading** | Warm · Slightly desaturated · Analogue film aesthetic (no Instagram filters) |
| **Perspective** | Worm's eye as statement · Eye-level with nature · Extreme macro permitted |
| **Copernicus / ESA** | ESA satellite data as unique La Palma image source (free under ESA Terms). Give data a face. |

### Photography — Micro

| | |
|---|---|
| **Subjects** | Architecture photography La Palma · Lava textures · Volcanic terraces · Worked stone and timber · Natural material close-ups |
| **Style** | Documentary-honest · High-contrast · No retouching · Show the material as it is |
| **Mood** | Quietly impressive. Like a craftsman's portfolio. Nothing performed. |
| **Forbidden (both)** | Stock photo aesthetic · Smiling businesspeople · Handshakes · Sunsets (except real La Palma) |
| **AI-generated** | Permitted when: nature motif · regenerative context · labelled 'AI-assisted' in caption |

### Sacred Geometry as Design Element

Structural in Macro, quiet depth-layer in Micro. Never louder than the content.

| Symbol | Use |
|---|---|
| **Dodecahedron (12 faces)** | Central symbol · Watermark, pattern or 3D object (max 8% opacity on Macro; max 3% on Micro) |
| **Flower of Life** | Background pattern · max 6% opacity · Macro-exclusive |
| **Fibonacci Spiral** | Compositional principle for photo cropping and layout — both levels |
| **Golden Ratio φ** | Proportional system for all layout decisions — both levels |
| **Vesica Piscis** | Symbol for transitions — sparingly, only in high-value Macro contexts |
| **Botanical cross-sections** | Micro background pattern — cell wall structures, radial plant geometry at 3–4% opacity |

### Iconography

| | Macro | Micro |
|---|---|---|
| **Style** | Line-based · Organic · Warm · Round cap · No right-angle system icons | Lucide Icons · 1.5px stroke · Brass (#C5B388) · `fill: none` · Hover: brass border emergence |
| **Weight** | 1.5–2px stroke · round cap · round join — both levels | |
| **Forbidden** | Standard icon sets without full customization | Filled icons · Multi-color icons · Neon glow on hover |

## 14 · Personal Brand — Martin Reiter

Martin Reiter is founder, channel, and pointer — not face and CEO. The brand is larger than the person. At the same time the person is visible and authentic — without becoming a cult.

### Positioning

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Channel · Transformer · Pointer — not guru, not expert, not influencer |
| **Personal voice** | First person · Experience-based · Vulnerable where relevant · No omniscience |
| **Differentiation** | Martin Reiter is recognizably more personal than either institutional brand, but fully shares their philosophy |
| **Image** | Natural, unstaged photos · Working situations · Nature context · No stage photos as primary image |

### What Does Not Work

| | |
|---|---|
| Not | Martin as sole voice of the brand — Rə:NatureFørce outlives the person |
| Not | Personal opinions published as brand positions without labelling |
| Not | Lifestyle content without connection to regeneration and philosophy |
| Not | Simultaneously speaking for Micro when the context requires Macro — keep levels clear |
