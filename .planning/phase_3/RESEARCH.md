# Research: Phase 3 - Brand Context & Documentation

## 1. Documentation Audit: `regenerative-blog-documentation.md`
- **Agent Count:** Must be updated from 8 to 10 in multiple locations.
- **Architecture Diagram:** Needs to include `image-agent` (post-writer) and `designer-agent` (staging).
- **Agent Roles:** New detailed sections required for `image-agent` (Technical Illustrator) and `designer-agent` (Brand Guardian).
- **Workflow Description:** Update Chapter 9 (Redaktions-Workflow) to include the new sequence.

## 2. Context Audit: `context/system-identity.md`
- **Visual Accuracy:** The identity should emphasize that visuals are not just decorative but "analytical tools" (data-viz).
- **Design Stance:** Explicitly mention the shift from "Prestige Brutalism" to "Natural Solarpunk × Avantgarde Prestige" (ReNatureForce v4.0) to ensure the AI knows the current brand version.

## 3. Prompt Verification
- `image-v1.md`: Successfully references `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` and Organic Precision.
- `designer-v1.md`: Successfully implements Fibonacci and φ-ratio checks.
- **Gap:** Ensure `writer-v1.md` is aware that its data will be visualized by the `image-agent` so it formats data clearly.

## 4. Project Completion
- `PROJECT.md` needs the current milestone marked as completed.
- `STATE.md` needs a final wrap-up tasks list.
