# Plan: Phase 5 - Workflow Deliverables & SOPs

## 1. Documentation Infrastructure
- [ ] Create directory `.planning/SOPs/`.
- [ ] Create `.planning/SOPs/.gitkeep` if needed (or just start writing).

## 2. Drafting individual SOPs
- [ ] **SOP 01:** Research Agent
- [ ] **SOP 02:** Writer Agent
- [ ] **SOP 03:** Image Agent
- [ ] **SOP 04:** Editor Agent
- [ ] **SOP 05:** Visual Agent
- [ ] **SOP 06:** Designer Agent
- [ ] **SOP 07:** Staging Agent
- [ ] **SOP 08:** Publish Agent
- [ ] **SOP 09:** Distribution Agent
- [ ] **SOP 10:** Memory Agent

## 3. Integration & Finalization
- [ ] Review all SOPs for consistency.
- [ ] Update `regenerative-blog-documentation.md` to link to the `.planning/SOPs/` directory.
- [ ] Verify that every script/YAML mentioned in SOPs exists and matches the logic.

## 4. Verification
- [ ] Conduct a cross-check: Does every agent have a defined success criterion that can be automatically verified?
